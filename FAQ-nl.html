            If Android is under system memory (RAM) pressure, apps and service which are not needed at the moment are removed from active memory. This terminates an ongoing VPN connection. To ensure that the connection/OpenVPN survives the service runs with higher priority. To run with higher priority the application must display a notification. The key notification icon is imposed by the system as described in the previous FAQ entry. It does not count as app notification for purpose of running with higher priority.

            Multiple OpenVPN clients for Android exist. The most common ones are OpenVPN for Android (this client), OpenVPN Connect and OpenVPN Settings.<p>The clients can be grouped into two groups: OpenVPN for Android and OpenVPN Connect use the official VPNService API (Android 4.0+) and require no root and OpenVPN Settings which uses root.<p>OpenVPN for Android is an open source client and developed by Arne Schwabe.  It is targeted at more advanced users and offers many settings and the ability to import profiles from files and to configure/change profiles inside the app. The client is based on the community version of OpenVPN. It is based on the OpenVPN 2.x source code. This client can be seen as the semi officially client of the community. <p>OpenVPN Connect is non open source client that is developed by OpenVPN Technologies, Inc. The client is indented to be general use client and more targeted at the average user and allows the import of OpenVPN profiles. This client is based on the OpenVPN C++ reimplementation of the OpenVPN protocol (This was required to allow OpenVPN Technologies, Inc to publish an iOS OpenVPN app). This client is the official client of the OpenVPN technologies <p> OpenVPN Settings is the oldest of the clients and also a UI for the open source OpenVPN. In contrast to OpenVPN  for Android it requires root and does not use the VPNService API. It does not depend on Android 4.0+

            </h2>
            
            In my personal tests the main reason for high battery consumption of OpenVPN are the keepalive packets. Most OpenVPN servers have a configuration directive like 'keepalive 10 60' which causes the client and server to exchange keepalive packets every ten seconds. <p> While these packets are small and do not use much traffic, they keep the mobile radio network busy and increase the energy consumption. (See also <a href="http://developer.android.com/training/efficient-downloads/efficient-network-access.html#RadioStateMachine">The Radio State Machine | Android Developers</a>) <p> This keepalive setting cannot be changed on the client. Only the system administrator of the OpenVPN can change the setting. <p> Unfortunately using a keepalive larger than 60 seconds with UDP can cause some NAT gateways to drop the connection due to an inactivity timeout. Using TCP with a long keep alive timeout works, but tunneling TCP over TCP performs extremely poorly on connections with high packet loss. (See <a href="http://sites.inka.de/bigred/devel/tcp-tcp.html">Why TCP Over TCP Is A Bad Idea</a>)

            Newer OpenVPN for Android versions (0.6.29/March 2015) use a more secure default for the allowed cipher suites (tls-cipher "DEFAULT:!EXP:!PSK:!SRP:!kRSA"). Unfortunately, omitting the less secure cipher suites and export cipher suites, especially the omission of cipher suites that do not support Perfect Forward Secrecy (Diffie-Hellman) causes some problems. This usually caused by an well-intentioned but poorly executed attempt to strengthen TLS security by setting tls-cipher on the server or some embedded OSes with stripped down SSL (e.g. MikroTik).<p>To solve this problem the problem, set the tls-cipher settings on the server to reasonable default like tls-cipher "DEFAULT:!EXP:!PSK:!SRP:!kRSA". To work around the problem on the client add the custom option tls-cipher DEFAULT on the Android client.

            Opening a tun device while another tun device is active, which is used for persist-tun support, crashes the VPNServices on the device. A reboot is required to make VPN work again. OpenVPN for Android tries to avoid reopening the tun device and if really needed first closes the current TUN before opening the new TUN device to avoid to crash. This may lead to a short window where packets are sent over the non-VPN connection. Even with this workaround the VPNServices sometimes crashes and requires a reboot of the device.

            The Routing and interface configuration is not done via traditional ifconfig/route commands but by using the VPNService API. This results in a different routing configuration than on other OSes. <p>The configuration of the VPN tunnel consists of the IP address and the networks that should be routed over this interface. Especially, no peer partner address or gateway address is needed or required. Special routes to reach the VPN Server (for example added when using redirect-gateway) are not needed either. The application will consequently ignore these settings when importing a configuration. The app ensures with the VPNService API that the connection to the server is not routed through the VPN tunnel.<p>The VPNService API does not allow specifying networks that should not be routed via the VPN. As a workaround the app tries to detect networks that should not be routed over tunnel (e.g. route x.x.x.x y.y.y.y net_gateway) and calculates a set of routes that excludes this routes to emulate the behaviour of other platforms. The log windows shows the configuration of the VPNService upon establishing a connection.<p>Behind the scenes: Android 4.4+ does use policy routing. Using route/ifconfig will not show the installed routes. Instead use ip rule, iptables -t mangle -L
