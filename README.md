OpenVPN for Android
=============

Description
------------
With the new VPNService of Android API level 14+ (Ice Cream Sandwhich) it is possible to create a VPN service that does not root access. This project is a port of OpenVPN.

Developing
---------------
If you want to develop on ics-openvpn please read the [doc/README.txt](https://github.com/schwabe/ics-openvpn/blob/master/doc/README.txt) *before* opening issues or emailing me. 

Also please note that before contributing to the project that I would like to retain my ability to relicense the project for different third parties and therefore probably need a contributers agreement from any contributing party. To get started, [sign the Contributor License Agreement](https://www.clahub.com/agreements/schwabe/ics-openvpn).

You can help
------------
Even if you are no programmer you can help by translating the OpenVPN client into your native language. [Crowdin provides a free service for non commercial open source projects](http://crowdin.net/project/ics-openvpn/invite) (Fixing/completing existing translations is very welcome as well)

FAQ
-----
You can find the FAQ here (same as in app): http://ics-openvpn.blinkt.de/FAQ.html

Note to administrators
------------------------

You make your life and that of your users easier if you embed the certificates into the .ovpn file. You or the users can mail the .ovpn as a attachment to the phone and directly import and use it. Also downloading and importing the file works. The MIME Type should be application/x-openvpn-profile. 

Inline files are supported since OpenVPN 2.1rc1 and documented in the  [OpenVPN 2.3 man page](https://community.openvpn.net/openvpn/wiki/Openvpn23ManPage) (under INLINE FILE SUPPORT) 

(Using inline certifaces can also make your life on non Android platforms easier since you have only one file.)

For example `ca mycafile.pem` becomes
```
  <ca>
  -----BEGIN CERTIFICATE-----
  MIIHPTCCBSWgAwIBAgIBADANBgkqhkiG9w0BAQQFADB5MRAwDgYDVQQKEwdSb290
  [...]
  -----END CERTIFICATE-----
  </ca>
```
